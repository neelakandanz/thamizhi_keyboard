## 0.1.1

## 0.1.0

### Major UI Redesign & Architecture Overhaul
* 🎉 **Native-like Premium UI**: Completely redesigned the keyboard interface to mimic native operating system keyboards (Gboard/iOS), featuring polished margins, touch feedback, and smooth `AnimatedContainer` resizing.
* 🚀 **Responsive & Adaptive**: Fully supports Mobile, Tablet, Desktop, and Web. Wraps intelligently using a robust `LayoutBuilder` wrapper (`ThamizhiKeyboard`).
* 🧠 **Pure Dart Engine**: Core Tamil composition logic has been decoupled into `TamilEngine` for ultra-fast, predictable input without hanging the UI thread (framework-agnostic text prediction capable).
* ⚡ **Optimized State Layer**: Replaced deeply coupled UI variables with `KeyboardController` (pure Flutter `ValueNotifier`) for blazing-fast redraws and zero memory leaks.
* 🎨 **Theming Support**: Introduced customizable `KeyboardTheme` providing drop-in `light` and `dark` modes mirroring native aesthetics.
* 🐞 **Performance Upgrades**: Enforced `flutter_lints ^3.0.0` with strict analyzer coverage, removed all lag-inducing nesting, and isolated touch ripples in a `RepaintBoundary`.
* 🔨 **Upgraded Dependencies**: Bumped to `sdk: ">=3.0.0 <4.0.0"` and Flutter `3.10.0`.
